Notes:-
1. Command structure: <command -option(s) argument(s)[order of the args matter]>
2. Space is the command term separator
3. Options are used to modify the default behavior of the command, its often starts with hyphen '-'
4. Some commands supports the long form of the options, they start with '--'. Ex: date -u == date --universal
5. We can compress the options in a single hyphen but not for long form
6. Some option require the parameters, it is also compressible. Ex: ncal -A 1
7. When we combine option with its params, other options should be given separately
8. Navigation in man pages, space or f to next page, b to next page, /pattern for search in page
9. Content inside [] in synopsis of command means its optional
10. []... means can accept multiple option/args
